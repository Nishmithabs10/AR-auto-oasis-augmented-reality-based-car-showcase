AR Auto Oasis: Augmented Reality-Based Car Showcase
AR Auto Oasis is an innovative eCommerce platform designed for car showrooms, offering a comprehensive online car shopping experience. Users can browse car models, book test drives, contact the showroom, explore car finance assistance, and add cars to their cart. The standout feature of this platform is the integration of augmented reality (AR), allowing users to view a 3D model of the car in their physical space through their Android phones. This AR experience includes options to change the car's color and view various parts of the car, such as the body, wheels, and windows, providing an interactive and immersive car exploration experience.

The frontend of AR Auto Oasis is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. HTML is used to structure the web pages, while CSS is employed for styling. Bootstrap enhances the UI with responsive design and advanced components, making the website accessible and visually appealing on various devices.

For the backend, PHP is utilized to handle server-side logic and dynamic functionalities. A MySQL database is employed for storing and managing data, including car information, user details, and booking data. The augmented reality features are developed using Unity 3D and AR Toolkit, enabling the creation and integration of 3D car models into the AR application. This combination of technologies ensures a seamless and engaging user experience, setting a new standard for online car showrooms.
